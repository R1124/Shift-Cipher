# Shift-Cipher

Definition: Shift Cipher is one of the earliest and the simplest cryptosystems. A given plaintext is encrypted into a ciphertext by shifting each letter of the given plaintext by k positions.

An example of encrypting the plaintext by shifing each letter by 3 places. Which is called Caesar Cipher, used by Julius Caesar, one of the earliest user of cryptography.


Encrytion : f(p)  = (p+k) mod 26.

Decryption: f-1(p)= (p-k) mod 26.
